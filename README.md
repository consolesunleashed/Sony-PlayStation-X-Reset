# Sony PlayStation X-Reset

X-Reset is a stylish in-game-reset mod for the Sony PlayStation which uses a controller button combination to reset the console. This is useful for resetting back to the game select menu for devices such as PSIO and X-Station. The name and design of X-Reset was done to closely resemble that of the X-Station Quick Solder Board.

Available here is X-Reset 750X which is the PlayStation PU-22 version of the X-Reset which installs with no wires.
